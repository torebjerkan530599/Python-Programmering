# Gaddis: Programming Exercise 10-7
# This exercise use the Employee class in emp.py
# Create a program that stores Employee objects in a dictionary.
# Use the employee ID number as the key.
# The program should present a menu that lets the user perform the following actions:
#
# 1. Look up an employee in the dictionary
# 2. Add a new employee to the dictionary
# 3. Change an existing employeeâ€™s name, department, and job title in the dictionary
# 4. Delete an employee from the dictionary
# 5. List existing employees
# 6. Quit the program
#
# When the program ends, it should pickle the dictionary and save it to 
# a file. Each time the program starts, it should try to load the 
# pickled dictionary from the file. If the file does not exist, the 
# program should start with an empty dictionary.
