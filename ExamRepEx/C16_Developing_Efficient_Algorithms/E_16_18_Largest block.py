The problem for finding a largest block is described in Programming Exercise 10.29. 
Design an algorithm for solving this problem using the dynamic programming approach and analyze its complexity. 
Can you design an O(n2) algorithm for this problem?

TODO because dependent on an exercise outside curriculum
